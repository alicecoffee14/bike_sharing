Once we estimated the number of bike trips we can model the number of bike users per day. These are divided in two categories: registered users, that made a subscription to our service and pay a fixed monthly fee to obtain a lower price per minute, and occasional users. An increase of registered users during the year due to some perfoemance improvements and increase of popularity of our service is modeled. With this is mind and some assumption on the average bike ride time and frequency, we compute the minutes of bike usage per day and the relative income in euros. Finally, we give an estimation of the costumer satisfactions and the amount of new subscriptions per day. "
