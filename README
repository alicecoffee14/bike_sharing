############################# TECHNICAL TEST ##################################

Model and visualize some Key Performance Indicators of a bike sharing service.

******************************* Description ***********************************

You operate a fleet of 1000 bikes over 5 different cities. 
Goal: emulate and visualize data from a bike sharing operator perspective. For 
a  meeting with investors, present a summary of the main insights of the year 
2020, and a dashboard to support the presentation.

This test is a two-step work:
1)  In a first part, data are emulated from scratch in order to simulate the 
    service main KPIs over a year. A Jupyter Notebook called 'Zoov_bikes.ipynb', 
    contained in this directory, generates data and the describes the procedure.
    A csv file is produced and contained in this same directory under the name: 
    'bike_summary.csv'

2)  In a second part, use the generated data to build a dashboard on a data 
    visualization tool: Google DataStudio.
    The relative 3-pages presentation is accessible at this link:

******************************* Data Generation *********************************

Despite more insights on the procedure chosen to generate data are given along the 
notebook here are some of the key points and eventual leads for further 
improvements:
-   number of bike rides per day is assumed to depend on parameters such as 
    weather, temperature, season. An estimation of these conditio:ns is given for
    each city. A unique average temperature per city is given according to the 
    season, a possible improvement could be a more refined estimation (.i.e. vary
    the average temperature along different months). Moreover other dependencies such
    as week/weekend days or number of stations/residents, number of bike sharing 
    competitors etc., holiday periods could be introduced.
-   With the number of bike rides we can estimate the number of users and the 
    total minutes of bike rides per day. Assuming two type of users (registered and
    occasional) with different price per minute the total income of the day is 
    given. This very simple method do not include the monthly fee paid by users with
    subscriptions, which is a source of fixed income and stability for the company.
    Moreover an initial fixed fee can be introduced for each bike ride (.i.e. each 
    time a bike is taken 1 euro is charged). 
    Bikes could be differentiated into electrical and mechanical ones and add a 
    different pricing. Many more realistic details can in principle be added.
-   The number of registered users as well as the customer satisfaction is 
    modeled to be growing linearly in 2020: under the assumption that an
    improvement of performances as well as a larger popularity of our app is
    achieved, we construct an optimistic dataset with positive growth, which varies
    for each city. 
    Also in this case a more sophisticated modelization can be implemented adding
    a parameter describing the performance improvements, a correlation between 
    registered user increase and their satisfaction, different parameters of 
    satisfaction (.i.e. quality of the bike or the app, proximity of the stationâ€¦),
    etc.
 
******************************* Data Visualization *********************************

In the dashboard we used three pages to focus on three main aspects:

1)  The time dependence of number of users along the year to enlighten the weather and
    temperature dependence. What do we learn? We can decide to do maintenance progress 
    in winter where the usage is limited. We can also try to  base our income predictions 
    on detailed weather forecast. We might also add more bikes in a city like Madrid
    where many users per day are observed all along the year.
2)  We present the incomes per city along different months of the year. We show the 
    correlation between bike trips and bike users: the last one is lower because some
    people use our service twice or more times a day (food delivery, go back and 
    forth from work..). As we assumed the average bike trip minutes to be constant
    along the year, its fluctuation only has a dependence on the bike usage. 
3)  Our annual growth in term of new subscriptions and customer satisfaction;
    We are happy for the global increase but we might want to invest on cities
    like London where out users are not as keen on subscribe. The introduction of
    further parameters describing city road conditions, user habits, competitors could
    definitely refine our results on the performance and perspectives in different locations.
